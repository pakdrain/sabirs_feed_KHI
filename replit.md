# Weighbridge Camera Monitoring System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive weighbridge monitoring system that combines CCTV camera streaming with weight measurement functionality. The application provides real-time camera feeds, weight data collection, and form-based data entry for purchase and sales transactions. It's designed specifically for industrial weighbridge operations with support for both local Windows deployment and cloud hosting.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL session store
- **Video Streaming**: FFmpeg-based RTSP to MJPEG conversion
- **Serial Communication**: SerialPort library for weight scale integration

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Key Tables**:
  - `cameras` - Camera configuration and settings

- **Multi-unit Support**: Supports kg, g, and lb weight units
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and error handling

### Transaction Management
- **Purchase Forms**: Complete purchase transaction entry with weight tracking
- **Sales Forms**: Sales order management with delivery tracking
- **Deduction Calculations**: Automated bag weight and percentage deductions
- **Image Capture**: Automatic photograph capture during weighing operations

### User Interface Features

- **Dark Theme**: Professional monitoring interface optimized for industrial environments
- **Real-time Updates**: Live weight displays and camera feeds
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with user-friendly error messages

## Data Flow

### Camera Streaming Flow
1. RTSP camera connects to the system via network
2. FFmpeg process converts RTSP stream to MJPEG format
3. WebSocket connection manages stream control and status
4. Browser receives MJPEG stream via HTTP endpoint
5. Stream statistics are collected and stored in database

### Weight Data Flow
1. Weight scale connects via serial port (COM1 default)
2. Serial data is parsed and validated
3. Weight values are broadcast via WebSocket to connected clients
4. First and second weight measurements are captured for net weight calculation
5. Weight data is stored with transaction records

### Transaction Processing Flow
1. User initiates purchase/sale transaction
2. Vehicle and vendor information is entered
3. First weight is captured automatically
4. Camera image is taken and stored with slip number
5. Transaction details are saved to database
6. Second weight is captured for completion
7. Net weight and deductions are calculated
8. Final transaction record is generated

## Important Notes

- The license plate recognition system is designed to work with the actual camera (IP: 192.168.6.108) when deployed locally
- Camera has built-in ANPR functionality that should be utilized
- System requires real license plate detection from camera feed, not dummy/mock data
- The application should capture actual number plates visible in the camera and populate the vehicle number field automatically
